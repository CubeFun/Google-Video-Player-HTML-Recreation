# Google-Video-Player-HTML-Recreation

This is a simple Google Video Player Recreation in HTML!
NOTE:My coding is crap

Usage - 
1 Go to the html file location add a mp4 file in the same location as the player.html file
2 Go to the player.html and edit test.mp4 to (yourvideosname).mp4

ALSO MAKE SURE TO USE THIS ON GOOGLE CHROME!
